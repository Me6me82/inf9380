Some examples and hints about data types and their sizes and range.

Some languages have built in data types for complex numbers like
Julia and Fortran. Some define them as custom types. 

On Saga you can load the MPI module which also set up gcc/gfortran.
module load gompi/2019b


1)
This example show you the various sizes of variables 

gcc -o size.x size.c 
./size.x 


2)
This example is bit more complex, defining a module holding a
set of constants and variables. Then showing sizes and ranges. 

gfortran -o variables.x  variables.f90 
./variables.x 

Try another compiler to see if the 2008 standard a%re and a%im are
implemented. These lines are comented out in the example.





3)
Change the size of the integer and see how the range changes.

gcc -o integer-range.x integer-range.c
./integer-range.x 

Exaplain what's happening, remember the lecture about computer arithmetic.
